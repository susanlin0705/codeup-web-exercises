        <dt class="cat-faq">My Adopted Cat just Started Kneading Me; Why?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Nursing kittens knead their mother to get the milk flowing so they can nurse. When a cat kneads, it’s usually a sign of affection and happiness so with your adopted cat it means she has adjusted to you and is happy. She likes you. Consider this the highest complement.
            </dd>
        <dt class="cat-faq">My Cat’s Tail Movements Confuse Me</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Dog owners are often confused by a cat’s tail movements. The movements seem, at times, to be similar enough that perhaps they should have the same meanings. Yet at other times, they are completely different. Cats like to keep us guessing.
            </dd>
        <dt class="cat-faq">Do Cats Purr When They’re Happy?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                These inconsistencies are what make cats so mysterious and confusing for people. Again, as with tail movements, don’t look (or listen) to one part of your cat’s communication. Instead, look at all of it to determine what she’s trying to communicate.
            </dd>
        <dt class="cat-faq">Are All Calico Cats Always Female?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                Although calico cats are predomiantly female, every once in a while a male cat will show up with a calico pattern. These males generally have an extra X chromosome (they are XXY instead of the normal XY) and that extra X allows them to have both orange and black. These males are usually sterile.
            </dd>
        <dt class="cat-faq">Why Does My Cat Bury His Food?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">
                It’s not unusual for cats to try to bury their food or water after eating or drinking. Some merely paw at the floor while others are more diligent and will pull a small throw rug or towel over the bowl. This behavior is an instinctive one shown by wild cats of many species and sizes.
